approx disks space needed for build 3.5GB

this program likes at least 4Gb mem, and x86_64.
  and likes 2 or more cpus (much more)
  can build as i386, but you may run out of address space.
  also: build is parallel, need 1Gb mem per cpu or so...

<os> may be (currently) centos fedora suse ubuntu

0) mkdir -p /home/<os>/google_code
1) access the bld_scripts.tgz unpack
2) run bld_prepare.sh <os>
3) run bld_dynamic.sh <os>
or run bld_static.sh <os>

prepare installs a bunch of prerequisites.

bld_<dynamic/static> creates a full build/install in
/home/<os>/google_code/cinelerra/cinelerra-4.6.mod/bin

Note: code.google.com is disappearing.
all of this will change.
